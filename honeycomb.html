            <p class="pt-3 font-opens text-navy-1">When I started my internship at Remitbee, I realized fairly quickly 
                that the company lacked a lot of the design infrastructure that I was familiar with seeing at other companies. 
                Usually the onboarding process would begin with me becoming familiar with the design methods that the company used,
                and going over documentation and project files. This was not the case over here. 
                <br/> <br/>
                The company had released Remitbee 2.0 a few months prior, and up until this point the design department was a 1 man team. 
                Admittedly, he had done a great job at improving the product and as a result the company had started to grow at a rapid rate.
                This however meant that

                The focus of the company was shifting from creating a brand new product to maintaining,

        <p class="pt-3 font-opens text-navy-1">This seemed like a perfect opportunity to introduce a design system to the company.  
            With my past experience working with them, I believed that this would help the company estabilis a strong brand identity, 
            and make our design process overall much more streamlined

            <p class="pt-3 font-opens text-navy-1">
                My first course of action was to take inventory of what we had and document any inconsistencies. 
             I began by setting up a Figma file and started to dump all the design data that we had in one spot. 
            I started with the typography and colours, documenting where I saw each one being used. 
             Next, i began to put in all the components that we used. The biggest source of inconsistency i found were our tables,
            where we had multiple versions of the same design. In the end the file spanned multiple pages,
             with me making a meager attempt at organizing them in a way that sort of made sense

        <h3 class="font-alice text-navy-1 text-3xl  pt-16 pb-5">An organized system is not the same as a usable one</h3>
        <p class="pt-3 font-opens text-navy-1">
            From experience, I knew that it was one thing to have all your design assets organized, a
            nd completely different thing to have a system that truly made your process more efficient. There were a few ideas I began to explore to help us.

        <h3 class=" w-3/4 mx-auto font-opens text-salmon text-center text-xl pt-8">
            To be able to make a useful design system, I had to understand what the users thought and how they used the design files
        </h3>
        <p class="pt-3 font-opens text-navy-1 pt-8">
            I knew that my target audience for this wasn’t just me and the senior designer. The company hired co-ops regularly
            so I had to keep in mind that a new designer would be coming in every few months and would have to help maintain the system.
            Figma’s style library feature seemed like it would become particularly handy, especially for colours, typography, and shadows.
            I wanted designers to be able to click into existing styles and find exactly what they needed. As for the component library, 
            I had to make sure they would be easily accessible from the components tab. With how many we had, it was important that the naming 
            convention was clear, and that designers would be able to find items if they searched for them. 

               <br/> <br/>
               
            In addition to the designers, I also wanted to understand how I could design it so that it prevented misunderstandings between 
            the development and design teams. After some research and multiple interviews with the dev team, I learned that the majority of
            them had view only access of the files, that they usually did not click through layers to find colours, and that they could not 
            always see the spacing between objects, to save time the usually either eyeballed it. Furthermore, if the design did not clearly
            show all the states of a certain element, they would default to google material design.

            <p class="pt-3 font-opens text-navy-1">
                With how essential design systems seem to be becoming, there were plenty of examples for me to look through, 
                and get an understanding of the best way to organize our assets. Shopify’s Polaris, IBM’s Carbon, Google’s Material 
                design were a few that I believe are very well known as comprehensive design systems. However I do think its important
                to note that
