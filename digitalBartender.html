            <p class="main">Digital Bartender is a project that Iâ€™m currently working on. 
                I was approached by a classmate to the UX and UI designs for it. 
                This app runs off an Arduino and is displayed on a 480x320 display.
                 Users will be able to input ingredients and 8 different pumps and
                  based off the selected ingredients the app will display the potential drinks that can be made.

            <h3 class = "main">Problem</h3> <br>
            <p class="main">For this project, 6 unique screens needed to be created: The Home Page, 
                Settings page, Pump Test, Add Ingredients, Drinks, and Drink in progress. The main 
                challenge for this project were the technical limitations that it came with. In terms
                of UX and UI design, both the hardware and the software were limited in terms of what 
                graphical elements could be displayed, and what controls could be used.

                        The display is a 480 x 320 resolution, 3.5-inch display.

                        <br>
                        The control used to navigate through the page is a dial that allows users to navigate through the interface by rotating it or clicking by pressing the button. 
                        <br><br><br>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold" >Software:</span>
                        <br>
                        Filled and outlined shapes that may be displayed are: Rectangles, Squares, ovals, circles, triangles.  
                        <br><br>
                        Rectangles and Square can be rounded
                        <br><br>
                        BMP and RAW image file formats are the only acceptable image formations. Images can add up to a maximum of 250 kb
                        <br><br>
                        Transparent Images are not allowed
                        <br><br>
                        Text base font is 6x8 pixels. It is not transparent, however the background color may be changed
                        <br> <br>
                        Font can be scaled by a factor of 2, this will double the length and the width
                        <br> <br>
                        Font may not be bolded or italicized.
                        <br><br>
                        There is only 1 font
                        </p>
                        
                <br/>

                Since the controls were so limited, I decided to limit the functionality of each 
                screen to just its one basic function. This is to help both the user experience in 
                terms of navigation, and to make the screens less cramped and crowded. 
                <br> <br>
                By scrolling through with the dial, the item that is selected will have a highlighted box 
                around it. The dial itself will also provide tactile feedback by vibrating. To select 
                a section the dial can be pressed, and this will then allow the users to navigate through 
                the section. A second click will exit out of the section.  These rules will be hold true 
                for each page.  
                <br> <br>
                Since there is only 1 font, and limited space, I decided to use 3 different font sizes
                for headings, subheadings, and text
                <br> <br>
                I also ensured that pictures aren't used anywhere except for the drinks page 
                (which displays the image of the drink) because of limited memory. 
                <br><br>
                Another consideration has been to leave instructional text that helps 
                the user navigate the interface easier when the controls may not be as obvious. 
                
                <br><br><br>
                This is currently only the first iteration of this project, so my approach and 
                designs will be modified as the project progresses
