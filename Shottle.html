            <p class="main">Binge drinking is an area of concern for many upper year undergraduate
                students and their families, however, many of the negative side effects associated 
                with a night of heavy drinking are actually caused by dehydration. This product 
                aims to address this problem by making it easier for the users to access water,
                as well as encourage them to drink more water.

                Settings page, Pump Test, Add Ingredients, Drinks, and Drink in progress. The main 
                challenge for this project were the technical limitations that it came with. In terms
                of UX and UI design, both the hardware and the software were limited in terms of what 
                graphical elements could be displayed, and what controls could be used.

                The primary users of this product are recreational drinkers who want to reduce
                the negative effects of alcohol consumption, such as upper year undergraduate 
                students. These are people who live in environments where drinking is a part of 
                the culture, and is seen as away to socialize, or relieve stress. However, students 
                often drink without understanding how much consumption of alcohol is “too much”. 
                They are unaware of the importance of staying hydrated while drinking and encounter 
                numerous negative side effects such as lack of focus or head pain. This results in 
                hindered performance when working or listening to lectures.

                    prominent example of a tertiary user would be the faculty members of the school.These members
                    of the school are affected by the performance of primary users, who are the ones who
                    come into classes under the after-effects sof alcohol.

                <p class="main">
                    Our brainstorming and QFD chart led us to three different
                    low fidelity prototypes. The focus of these prototypes was
                    to encourage the user to drink more water, either by making
                    it easier to access water, or to remind the user to drink more
                    water. We gathered the pros and cons of all the designs
                    and translated that into our medium fidelity prototype. We
                    recognized the fact that the bottle should be of comfortable grip
                    width, encourage users to consume more water than alcohol,
                    and should have a lid to avoid spills. For user testing, we
                    explored various color options for visibility and appearance. We
                    also tested various grip heights and bottle widths for our target
                    users. With the user testing information from the two previous
                    rounds of prototyping, we refined our product design into a PET
                    water bottle with an alcohol compartment.

                    The final product as a waterbottle with 
                    Turn the lid to access the alcohol compartment! The lid automatically spins
                    back to the “water” position to passively encourage the user to drink water
                    <br><br><br>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold">Lid:</span>
                    <br>
                    After user testing, we increased the size of the hole in the bottle lid accessing the water compartment as 
                    we learned the previous hole was too small and reduced water flow. This fails to encourage users to consume
                     more water and our original purpose, thus the change had to be made. Threading was also added to the lid, 
                     , and bottle body to easily attach each compartment. The lid is made of two parts, the bottom contains a track
                      where the twisting mechanism occurs. The twisting mechanism comprises of a spring attached to the stopper, 
                      and a strong magnet attached to the other face of the stopper. The top part of the lid has an extrusion that 
                      fits into the track. One face of the extrusion is used to push the spring, and the opposite face contains a 
                      magnet that is attracted to the magnet on the stopper in the bottom half. Once combined, the mechanism allows 
                      the lid to spin, and snap back in place. Furthermore, the top of the lip will be completely flat and the axis 
                      that the lid spins on does not pass the top of the lid.

                    <span style="font-weight: bold" >Material:</span>
                    <br>
                    The material chosen for our final design is polyethylene terephthalate copolymer because it is our best option as determined through 
                    a best of class chart. In addition, keeping our primary user’s financial situations in mind, PET is also a more affordable option 
                    than other conventional materials such as stainless steel. Rubber sealings need to be added onto the bottle body,
                     between the two halfs of the lid, and  on compartment body to reduce the likelihood of liquid spilling out of each part.
                    <br><br><br>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold" >Manufacturing:</span>
                    <br>
                    Originally our high fidelity prototype was 3D printed with Ultra-T material, but through our user testing, 
                    we realized the bottle failed to be waterproof. As this does not meet our basic function requirements, we decided to outsource the
                     production to reputable PET bottle manufacturers for our final product.
                    <br><br><br>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold" >Color:</span>
                    <br>
                    Upon user testing, we made the bottle black as it was a neutral colour that did not get dirty quickly. 
                    Black also gives the bottle a minimalistic look which was popular among our testers. The grip was made gray to 
                    provide contrast, so users could differentiate the two materials easily. 
                    <br><br><br>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold" >Magnets:</span>
                    <br>
                    After testing, we noted that the magnets we had placed in the bottom part of the lid were not strong enough 
                    to hold the top part of the lid closed. Therefore we would research different types of magnets that are stronger 
                    than the ones we used originally. 
                    <br><br><br>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold" >Grip:</span>
                    <br>
                    After researching our competition, we were inspired to install a silicone material onto our bottle
                     to allow our users to easily grip our product at 7cm from the top of the bottle.
