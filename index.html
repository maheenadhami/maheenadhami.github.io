        <p class="right">I’m a Systems design engineering student at the university of waterloo 
                that’s passionate about design and the product lifecycle.<br/> <br/> I like to think of 
                myself as fluid: someone that can adapt to anything, and someone that loves
                spreading out to explore the new things. I come from a pretty diverse background
                that’s allowed me to a part of the complete product lifecycle. <br/> <br/> I’m also a

        <p class="left">Over the summer, I was a UX Designer at Soulfx Technologies where I designed 
                software and websites that are used by healthcare and pharmaceutical companies. 
                A lot of my work focused on the systems design of the components that we were created

        <p class="right">Currently I’m working on designing the interface for a digital bartender 
                device which lets users select a drink, then mixes it. This project had many technical
                limitations but has been a great challenge to work on. <br/> <br/>

        <p class="left">I’ve also worked on developing a product in collaboration with a few others that helps
            promote healthy alcohol consumption in upper year students. This project focused on user research,
            and following an iterative design process. <br/> <br/>

        <p class="right">Another cool project that I’ve worked on is an escape room game called dead zone.
            I developed it using java and had a lot of fun doing the game design for it.
